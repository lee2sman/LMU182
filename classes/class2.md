Homework for next Wednesday:
*  Signup/make an account so you can save your sketches in the alpha Editor: https://alpha.editor.p5js.org/signup
*  Make a neutral face

> Design an abstract or simplified face composed of 10-20 basic shapes (rectangles, ellipses, lines, triangles, polygons, stars). Look at the links and images below as a reference. Create two emotions for this face, one neutral, and one exaggerated. For instance, a very sad frown, and a neutral expression. Have a plan in mind for how the face might transition from neutral to exaggerated. You may only move, rotate, and scale the facial features, it should not “pop” from one expression to the next. Think about all the different faces we’ve looked at and how you can construct a face both human or non-human.
>
> Before you begin coding, sketch this face out either on paper, or in photoshop/illustrator/your software of choice and bring them to class on Wednesday 9/7. Also arrive with your neutral face translated into p5 code. Make sure your sketch size is set at 500px x 500px
