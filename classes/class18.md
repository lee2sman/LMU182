# Class 18

# In-class
* Review passing parameters to a function
* Local vs Global variables
* Tutorial on Classes and Objects
* Sprites in p5play (as times allows) - [Examples](http://p5play.molleindustria.org/examples/index.html?fileName=sprite.js)

# Starter code
* A basic sketch showing how to use [Objects](http://alpha.editor.p5js.org/2sman/sketches/BJt4Lk_0W) - *note: this uses the new ES6 system, different than what is in the Getting Started with P5JS book*
* A sketch with [objects and input parameters](http://alpha.editor.p5js.org/2sman/sketches/BJt4Lk_0W) 

# Definitions

* Class is the cookie-cutter
* Object is each cookie (aka instantiation)
* Methods are functions inside of classes. They can only be used by objects created based on that class.
* Special note: you may see *let* used in online tutorial videos. It's the new version of *var*.

# Homework
### Watch
* Review [Classes in Javascript with ES6](https://www.youtube.com/watch)
* Review [Constructor Arguments with Classes in ES6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHiSsgFRgx4)

### Code
* Code the functionality and/or movement for player
* Think about what classes you need in your game and code a class for them
* Otherwise: start and finish art assets (players, background of screen, sounds, etc)

Version 1 in-progress of game (without finalized graphics but with working basic functionality) will be due next Wednesday November 15
