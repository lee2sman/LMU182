# Due Monday
* Project 1 Part B

Add variables to your project from Part A so that the face can move between the neutral and exaggerated expressions by changing the value of the variables. The variables can change the color, position, scale, rotation, etc. of your face. Don't forget to write comments in your code so that you know the range of the variable i.e int x = 100; // left eye x - coordinate with a value between 100 and 200. Be careful when trying out rotation and scale, they can be tricky.

Bring this code to class on Monday September 11 to work on during in class studio time. One more reference for you! [Mattias Dorfelt's Weird Faces](http://www.mokafolio.de/works/Weird-Faces)
