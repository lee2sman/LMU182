# Project 2 - Nonlinear Narrative

# Part A

For project 2, you will create an interactive non-linear (i.e. choose your own adventure) story in the form of a photo-novel or comic book (A photo-novel is essentially a comic that uses photos instead of drawings). Your story should have a minimum of 10 and a maximum of 15 scenes and have at least three different conclusions. Try to keep it simple and spend more time thinking about the interactions, images, and text. Here's a little short story if you're having trouble getting started writing...Do supertoys last all summer long

Make your project 600 x 600 px in size.

For part A, complete a flow chart storyboard with images and text diagramming the flow of your story. You may draw your chart by hand or create it in Photoshop or Illustrator. If you draw it by hand please make a digital copy. Be ready to present your story to the class on Wednesday 9/20!

Due Wednesday 9/20

# Part B

Begin converting your story into p5 scenes. Make a new sketch for each scene / room in your story.

Due Monday 9/25

# Part C
Once you have created a sketch for each of your scenes / rooms, combine them all into one single p5.js project using conditional statements. Use at least 3 sounds in your final piece. Here are some free sound resources
