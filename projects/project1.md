# Project 1 - Two Faced

## Part A
Design an abstract or simplified face composed of 10-20 basic shapes (rectangles, ellipses, lines, triangles, polygons, stars). Look at the links and images below as a reference. Create two emotions for this face, one neutral, and one exaggerated. For instance, a very sad frown, and a neutral expression. Have a plan in mind for how the face might transition from neutral to exaggerated. You may only move, rotate, and scale the facial features, it should not “pop” from one expression to the next. Think about all the different faces we’ve looked at and how you can construct a face both human or non-human.

Before you begin coding, sketch this face out either on paper, or in photoshop/illustrator/your software of choice and bring them to class on Wednesday 9/7. Also arrive with your neutral face translated into p5 code. Make sure your sketch size is set at 500px x 500px

Due Wednesday 9/6

## Part B
Add variables to your project from Part A so that the face can move between the neutral and exaggerated expressions by changing the value of the variables. The variables can change the color, position, scale, rotation, etc. of your face. Don't forget to write comments in your code so that you know the range of the variable i.e int x = 100; // left eye x - coordinate with a value between 100 and 200. Be careful when trying out rotation and scale, they can be tricky.

Bring this code to class on Monday September 11 to work on during in class studio time. One more reference for you! Mattias Dorfelt's Weird Faces

Due Monday 9/11 - Submit your Project 1 Part B Here

## Part C
Modify your code from part B so that the face changes fluidly from the neutral expression to the strong expression as you move the mouse across the screen. The map function will be your friend for this. You will need to include a setup() and draw() to your project so that variables in the draw() can be updated on the fly. Think about how you can develop in-between expressions and make the face as dynamic and emotive as possible.
