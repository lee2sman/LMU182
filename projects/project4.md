# Project 4 A Game!

## Part A

For project 4 we will be creating a simple game in p5js with the library p5play. Pick a game below or a classic game of your choice. Describe its gameplay. What are its variables and functions. Describe the main action in pseudocode.

Now begin brainstorming a game idea. You will need to determine a concept, rules, objectives, win-state, and lose-state. Think about collisions, points, and the start and instruction screens. Is this multiplayer or singleplayer (multi-player games encouraged!). Plan on paper, begin sketching, and transition to sketching digitally.

Some games to review:

### Classic arcade games
* [Frogger](http://www.frogger.net/)

### New games

This is not meant to be an exhaustive list of games or to indicate a full range of game-makers and their approach to making games. This is a starting list of contemporary independent and DIY game-makers, particularly demonstrating games that are compelling and clear underlying programming logic and code architecture.
