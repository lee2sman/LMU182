# Project 4 A Game!

## Part A

For project 4 we will be creating a simple game in p5js with the library p5play. You will need to determine a concept, rules, objectives, win-state, and lose-state. Think about collisions, points, and the start and instruction screens. Is this multiplayer or singleplayer (multi-player games encouraged!). Plan on paper, begin sketching, and transition to sketching digitally.

Game Plan

* Due Monday 10/30

## Part B

Now that you have all of your sketching created, run mini playtests, and code up your game iteratively, fixing problems as you go and testing to make sure it makes sense and is fun to play.

### Due:

**11/23**
