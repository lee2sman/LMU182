# Project 3 â€¢ Anim-instrument

# Part A

For project 3 we will be creating a musical instrument that can be played by pressing different keys. When you press a key your program should play a sound and trigger an animation. For the first part of this assignment, create between 5 - 26 different sketches that have their own distinct sound / animation combo. Make sure each animation is encapsulated inside of a function. Think about the relationship between sound and motion? What motions make sense with what sounds?

### Examples
* [Symphonie Diagonale](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uc5qPMSVixQ) - Viking Eggeling, 1924
* [Anemic Cinema](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXINTf8kXCc) - Marcel Duchamp, 1926
* [An Optical Poem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=they7m6YePo) - Oskar Fischinger, 1938
* [Patatap](http://www.patatap.com/) - Jono Brandel
* [Ming Micro video synthesizer](http://www.specialstagesystems.com/system-overview/) - Special Stage Systems, 2016
